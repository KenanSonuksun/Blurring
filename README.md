# Blurring
<br><br>
 The project is about Image Processing.
 <br><br>
blurring an image is make the image less sharp. This can be done by smoothing the colour transition between the pixels. 
To accomplish this target, we need to apply a convolution operation of a specialized matrix, called kernel, to the image's matrix.The project has been created for this mission.
